# Portal's Still Alive: JS Recreation
No one has said this sentence, ever.

https://laurcons.ro/projects/12

## Installation
You should be able to drag-and-drop these files into XAMPP's /htdocs folder or any Apache installation. Even though this is JavaScript, it requires a webserver setup because it uses AJAX calls and it has one PHP file.

You need to download the audio and place it in the same directory as index.html, named `still-alive.mp3`.

## Code quality
Not great, not terrible.

It's all put together so it just works. It certainly can be optimized.

## Contributing
Do, by all means. It would mean the world to me.
