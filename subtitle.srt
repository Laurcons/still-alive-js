This was a triumph<br>

00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,818
I'm making a note here:<br>

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,782
HUGE SUCCESS.<br>

5

We do what we must<br>

00:00:29,455 --> 00:00:31,226
because we can.<br>

10

over every mistake.<br>

14

You just keep on trying<br>

16
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:47,981
And the Science gets done.<br>

17
00:00:48,054 --> 00:00:49,913
And you make a neat gun.<br>

18

I'm being

 sincere right now.<br>

27

Even though you broke my heart.

28
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:13,611
And killed

 me.<br>

30

We're releasing on time.<br>

So I'm GLaD. I got burned.<br>

40

Think of all the things we learned<br>

 I prefer
